### Abstract

In this essay I introduce the concept of _substitutive visibility_ to describe the displacement of distributed epistemic labour by the centralised image of executive authority in universities, and develop the related concept of _epistemic monarchism_ to capture the representational regime that results when such substitution becomes systemic. I also propose a _pedagogy of openness_ as a normative alternative to the pedagogy of authority embedded in executive-centred branding, extending fiduciary openness into the pedagogical and representational domain. I argue that these practices are not neutral features of branding but mechanisms of epistemic clientelism, whereby recognition is converted into a clientelist ‘currency’ and appropriated as symbolic capital for institutional leadership. Drawing on fiduciary theory, I show that substitutive visibility and epistemic monarchism constitute breaches of the duties of loyalty, openness, and care owed by universities as fiduciary custodians of epistemic trust. Through analogy to fiduciary case law, I demonstrate that the misallocation of epistemic credit mirrors the misappropriation of trust property. I further situate these breaches within the framework of epistemic injustice, showing how testimonial and contributory injustices are compounded by executive-centred branding. To address these distortions, I propose a programme of reform grounded in fiduciary openness: epistemic audits, fiduciary reporting, ombudspersons for representational equity, redistributive practices, and the cultivation of resistant imagination. Taken together, these measures resist the reduction of knowledge to charisma and restore the university’s legitimacy as a custodian of the epistemic commons.
